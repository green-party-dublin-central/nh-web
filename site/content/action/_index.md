You can make a difference. 

**Help my campaign**

We need volunteers on the ground in Dublin Central to canvas, deliver leaflets and take part in local events. You can also come along to a branch meeting (for inspiration or just a chat).  Get in [touch with me](/contact) or the [Dublin Central Branch](mailto:dublincentral@greenparty.ie) to find out more.

**Donate to my campaign**

Your donation allows me to connect with people and get a message of social equality and environmental responsibility out there. Please help me work towards a better future for all.
