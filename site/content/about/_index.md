I joined the Green Party in 2011 with a clear conviction that Ireland needs a voice at national level on sustainable and ethical living, climate change and critical environmental matters. I trained as an architect who specialises in sustainable development and I have worked as a consultant and university lecturer in this field. I have a masters in environmental design and a postgrad in third level education.

During my professional career I have worked in the private and public sector as an architect and a consultant in sustainability on a number of major infrastructural projects in Ireland including as an environmental design specialist on the recent Mater Adult Hospital in our constituency. My professional experience includes:

* Lecturer in Sustainable Design and Materials at Queens University Belfast from 2010 to 2016
* Head of Sustainable Design for Scott Tallon Walker Architects, Dublin
* BBC Expert Woman's Panel 2015
* Green Party Chair of Policy Council 2016-2017 and Deputy Chair of Policy Council 2015-2016

As a full time carer for a disabled child I will work towards communities where we all can enjoy safe and accessible streets, affordable access to housing and services, food security, peace and equal opportunities

I have been involved in community volunteer work for many years including work with Age Action Ireland, helping to establish and run a charity shop for a charity for the visually impaired and volunteering every week at my local Day Centre where I run a therapeutic art class.
