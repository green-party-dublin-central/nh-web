## Development

The development comprises 103 residential units. Current mix of the 103 residential units is:

* 10 studio (9.7%)
* 33 one-bedroom (32%)
* 60 two-bedroom (58.3%)

This a build to rent development.  As such there are no restrictions on dwelling mix ([Specific Planning Policy Requirement 8](https://www.opr.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2018-Design-Standards-for-New-Apartments-1.pdf)) .

## Social Housing

Under Part V the development will set aside 10 units (6 one bed and 4 two bedroom units) for Dublin City Council social housing. 

## Height

The building will be six - nine storeys over basement level. 

The proposed development has a maximum height of 31.23m (from street level to the top of the parapet).

The Dublin City Development Plan has a height limit of 16m for this area. The developer has prepared a [Material Contravention Statement](https://www.royaloakshd.ie/data/files/Planning%20Application%20Documents/Planning/Statement%20of%20Material%20Contravention.pdf) outlining why it feels a height of 31.23m is appropriate.
