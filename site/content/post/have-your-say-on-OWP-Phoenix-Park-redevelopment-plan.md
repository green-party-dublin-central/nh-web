  Did you know that the OPW and Failte Ireland plan to redevelop the Phoenix
  Park? It's quite the plan: make the Bloom carpark permanent, new buildings and
  retail (not a whole lot about trees.....)

[Dec 2019 - an update on this campaign can be found [here](https://neasahourigan.com/post/update-on-the-plans-to-redevelop-the-phoenix-park/)]

## What is happening?

Our government has just declared a Climate and Biodiversity Emergency. That means that at every level, from our own gardens to the incredible space of the Phoenix Park we should be looking to support and enhance nature and our Irish flora and fauna. 

The OPW and Failte Ireland however plan to redevelop the Phoenix Park. One section of the park will be about 'biodiversity' and the rest will be commemoration and amenities. The Green Party would like to see the Phoenix Park as the wild heart of the city, not as just and only a profit engine for tourists.

## What can I do?
