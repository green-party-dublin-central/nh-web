  Number 8 and 10 Ferguson Road, Drumcondra were taken over by Dublin City
  Council in January 2019 under the Derelict Sites Act. Cllr. Darcy Lonergan
  received a reply in July 2020 from council to the effect that the Property
  Disposal section in Dublin City Council has requested the City Valuer's Office
  to bring the properties to market as soon as possible. The Valuer's Office is
  preparing a report for City Councillors detailing the sales process.
