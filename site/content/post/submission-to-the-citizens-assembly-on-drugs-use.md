The Green Party fought hard to secure a commitment to the Assembly in the 2020 Programme for Government, as a key step in drug law reform. The Party’s 2020 manifesto calls for a shift to health-led drug policy, including drug law reform, allowing cannabis prescription, and various measures to decriminalise personal possession. We need an evidence-based drug policy that comes from a position of harm reduction. Thousands of people in addiction are treated as the enemy, rather than someone in need of help.

The consequences of our approach to drugs affect all parts of our society, undermining our health and justice systems, driving homelessness, and supporting organised crime and anti-social behaviour. Neasa has emphasised these points within her submission.

The Citizens Assembly is expected to deliver its conclusions by the end of this year.
