## What is a Large-scale Residential Development (LRD)

Large-scale Residential Development is the process that replaces the Strategic Housing Development (SHD) process. It is similar to the SHD process in that it deals with applications for 100 or more houses or 200 or more student accommodation bed spaces.

A key difference however is that Large-scale Residential Development applications are made directly to the local authority (Dublin City Council in this case). Strategic Housing Development applications were made to An Bord Pleanála.

## Unix Mix

The development will comprise

* 65 one bed apartments
* 68 two bed apartments

According to the applicant 

* all 65 of the one bed apartments are suitable for two people
* 9 of the two bed apartments are suitable for three people
* the remaining 59 of the two bed apartments are suitable for four people

## Height

* Block A: 4 storeys, 15.9m 
* Block B 10 storeys, 35.1m
* Block C 9 storeys, 32m 

## Part V Social Housing

Dublin City Council’s preferred option is to acquire units on site to fulfil the Part V Social Housing obligation. The Part V Social Housing comprises:

* One Bed - 17 units
* Two bed - 10 units

27 in total which is approximately 20% of the total units on the site.

All of the 16 units in block A will be social housing units.
11 of the units in block B will be social housing units (all on the first and second floor).

## Transport

25 car parking spaces broken down as follows:
* 24 for residents (3 share spaces, 2 mobility impaired spaces and 13 electric vehicle spaces.)
* 1 for the crèche

424 bicycle spaces broken down as follows:
- 336 long-stay bicycle parking spaces
- 88 short stay bicycle parking spaces
This includes 2 cargo bike spaces



## Zoning

The site is zoned as "Z10: Inner Suburban and Inner City Sustainable Mixed-Uses" which intends “to consolidate and facilitate the development of inner city and inner suburban sites for mixed-uses.”.

A more detailed description of the zoning can be found in the [Land-use Zoning chapter of the Dublin City Development Plan](https://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/2022-12/Final%201-14%20Land%20Use%20Zoning%2005.12.22.pdf).

## Plot ratio and site coverage

* Plot Ratio - 2.65 (amount of floorspace in relation to the site area). The indicative Plot Ratio in the current development plan for this area is 1.0-2.5
* Site Coverage - 73% (the percentage of the site covered by building structures). The indicative Site Coverage in the current development plan for this area is 45-60% .

## Two applications side by side

This area is being developed under two separate applications. This LRD application is the second phase. The first phase is a Strategic Housing Development for 183 build-to-rent apartments. That application was made to An Bord Pleanála on 23rd December 2021 (case number [312352](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/case/312352))  and was supposed to be decided in April 2022.  Further details can be found on [www.richmondroadshd.ie](https://www.richmondroadshd.ie/).
