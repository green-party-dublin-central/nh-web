The application is being made directly to An Bord Pleanála under the Strategic Housing Development  (more than 100 units) legislation. The first step in that process is a consultation between the developer, An Bord Pleanála and Dublin City Council. The application to start that stage of the process was submitted 11th August 2021 (Ref [311079](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/case/311079)) and is due to complete 12th October 2021.

Should An Bord Pleanála deem the application to be valid, the developer can then move to the second phase which is the period during which members of the public may submit their observations on the application.

The site has been derelict for too long. That said there are big issues with Build to Rent apartments not least of which is the fact that none of these apartments will be sold to members of the public.

Currently there is existing permission permission on the site for:

* 2016 Dublin City Council Ref [3420/16](https://planning.agileapplications.ie/dublincity/application-details/117443) - 19 residential units (houses and apartments) and 1 retail
* 2018 An Bord Pleanála Ref [300666](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/case/300666) - 208 student accommodation bedrooms
