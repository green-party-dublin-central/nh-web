description: The first stage in a Strategic Housing Development application for
  137 Build to Rent apartments on the old Matts of Cabra site was made to An
  Bord Pleanála on 11th August 2021. An Bord Pleanála issued its opinion on the
  Pre-Application Consultation on the 28th October (essentially a number of
  points it would like the applicant to address in any formal application). It
  is now for the applicant to make a full planning application to An Bord

The application is being made directly to An Bord Pleanála under the Strategic Housing Development  (more than 100 units) legislation. The first step in that process is a consultation between the developer, An Bord Pleanála and Dublin City Council. The application to start that stage of the process was submitted 11th August 2021 (Ref [311079](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/case/311079)).

An Bord Pleanála issued its [opinion on the Pre-Application Consultation](/img/pre-application-consultation-opinion-matts.pdf) on the 28th October.  In summary there a number of points it would like the applicant to address in any formal application:

* Design Strategy - further consideration and/or justification as they relate to:

  * height and scale given the location, adjoining lands.
  * Open Space Strategy
  * Feedback received from DCC Planners
  * Suitability of the site for proposed height and housing mix
  * How the design complies with "Urban Development and Building Heights - Guidelines for Planning Authorities" SPPR3
* A report that addresses residential amenity, specifically how the development will limit potential impacts on adjoining properties in terms of overlooking and overbearing.
* Further consideration of the traffic impacts: Fassaugh Avenue, amount of parking proposed, pedestrian & cycle links with public transport
* A set of reports are requested around: Housing Quality, impact on school and crèche demand, Ecological Impact Assessment, Construction Management Plan, etc. 

The developer can now move to the second phase which is the period during which members of the public may submit their observations on the application.

The site has been derelict for too long. That said there are big issues with Build to Rent apartments not least of which is the fact that none of these apartments will be sold to members of the public.

Currently there is existing permission permission on the site for:

* 2016 Dublin City Council Ref [3420/16](https://planning.agileapplications.ie/dublincity/application-details/117443) - 19 residential units (houses and apartments) and 1 retail
* 2018 An Bord Pleanála Ref [300666](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/case/300666) - 208 student accommodation bedrooms
