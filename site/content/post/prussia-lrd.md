## What is a Large-scale Residential Development (LRD)?

Large-scale Residential Development is the process that replaces the Strategic Housing Development (SHD) process. It is similar to the SHD process in that it deals with applications for 100 or more houses or 200 or more student accommodation bed spaces.

A key difference however is that Large-scale Residential Development applications are made directly to the local authority (Dublin City Council in this case). Strategic Housing Development applications were made to An Bord Plean√°la.

## Part V Social Housing

The provisions for Social and Affordable Housing under Part V of the Planning Acts do not apply to student accommodation.
