## What is a Large-scale Residential Development (LRD)?

Large-scale Residential Development is the process that replaces the Strategic Housing Development (SHD) process. It is similar to the SHD process in that it deals with applications for 100 or more houses or 200 or more student accommodation bed spaces.

A key difference however is that Large-scale Residential Development applications are made directly to the local authority (Dublin City Council in this case). Strategic Housing Development applications were made to An Bord Pleanála.

## Layout

* Arranged over two main blocks
* 5 stories over basement

## Part V Social Housing

The provisions for Social and Affordable Housing under Part V of the Planning Acts do not apply to student accommodation.

## Parking

There is no car parking proposed on site. No staff car parking is proposed within the scheme.

There will be 373 secure bicycle parking spaces for residents and 75 visitor bicycle parking spaces. 

The site contains a designated refuse truck collection and turning area, which doubles as a loading bay for the café.
