description: The Green Party has today launched a roadmap for maternal care,
  calling for urgent action to address the shortfall in services and supports
  for pregnant women and new mothers. As the country recovers from the Covid-19
  pandemic and the enormous impact it has had on our health services, we need to
  prioritise women’s health and wellbeing which have been long neglected.

Launching [the paper](/docs/GP_ROADMAP_MATERNAL_CARE.pdf), Neasa Hourigan said:,

*“Prior to the onset of the Covid-19 global pandemic, we were all acutely aware of the improvements needed across a range of issues relating to women’s health and wellbeing in Ireland. The arrival of Covid-19 has not only served to exacerbate these deficiencies but also highlighted how fragile these services and supports were to begin with. It is crucial that as we emerge from the worst of the pandemic period, we take a critical look at these vital services and set out a plan to build back better and ensure that we have a robust and resilient system of care and support for women.”*

The roadmap lays out a number of key priorities over the next 12 months. These include:

* The creation of a Family Centred Plan for Maternal Care
* A Two-Year Extension and Dedicated Funding Package for the National Breastfeeding Action Plan
* Supporting the Milk Bank Scheme across Ireland
* A Commitment to Reproductive Rights based Healthcare
