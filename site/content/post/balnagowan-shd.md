## Protected Structure

Balnagowan House is a Protected Structure (ref: 8699 on the [Record of Protected Structures](https://www.dublincity.ie/residential/planning/archaeology-conservation-heritage/record-protected-structures/about-record-protected-structures)). This does not prevent development of the structure but does require that any changes that would materially affect its character are approved through planning permission.
