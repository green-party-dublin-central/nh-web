  Right now you might be weighing up the candidates in Dublin Central to decide
  where your first preference should go. Below are some of the issues that are
  important to me. If these issues are also important to you I'd appreciate your
  first preference on Saturday February 8th.

## Housing and transport

Vote No. 1 for me if...

* You think people stuck in traffic is a failure not a sign of economic activity {{< youtube lP2GkOqCmn0 >}}
* You think [public housing should be built on public lands](https://www.greenparty.ie/over-20000-homes-could-be-built-on-public-lands-in-dublin-city-greens/) in the centre of our towns and cities.
* You think we need to [be vocal](https://neasahourigan.com/post/housing-sit-down/) about the poor state of housing supply in Dublin
* You think Cost Rental is a great idea {{< youtube SX8iG_mowjs >}}
* You think we should do more to [reduce the number of derelict sites](https://neasahourigan.com/post/vacancy-and-dereliction-in-the-inner-city/) 
* You think [CoHousing not co-living](https://neasahourigan.com/post/greens-say-no-to-coliving-yes-to-cohousing/) is the way to go
* You think [Streets are For People](https://neasahourigan.com/post/streets-are-for-people/)

* You think [pedestrians need a voice](https://neasahourigan.com/post/inaugural-meeting-of-irish-pedestrian-network/)

## Finance

Vote No. 1 for me if...

* You think [our budgets](https://www.greenparty.ie/budget-2020-neasa-hourigan/) should "make progress on the climate crisis while improving the lives of those on the lowest incomes" and not "prioritise business over quality of life"
* You have questions about spending €22m on a white-water rafting centre in Dublin {{< youtube Wtipvkv70hc>}}
* You think we'd be better tackling our carbon emissions than [paying fines of up to 600 ](https://neasahourigan.com/post/despite-brexit-budget-cost-of-fine-gael-climate-inaction-set-to-skyrocket/)million annually from 2020
* You think the Carbon Tax as introduced by the government is unfair to those on lower incomes and in rural areas {{< youtube WAuBD9FHRgo>}}
* You think the 80% tax on [windfall profits for land speculators](https://neasahourigan.com/post/greens-warn-of-over-1-5bn-loss-to-state-if-rezoning-levies-issue-not-remedied/) on lands rezoned for housing purposes should be reintroduced (this tax was abolished by Fine Gael under pressure from developers)

## Environment

Vote No. 1 for me if...

* You think [the Phoenix Park needs a strong voice](https://neasahourigan.com/post/update-on-the-plans-to-redevelop-the-phoenix-park/) to prevent it being developed into a retail destination
* You think [green spaces (even small ones) are important](https://neasahourigan.com/post/green-up-cabra-glasnevin/) in our local community
* You think [increasing cruise traffic in Dublin Port](https://neasahourigan.com/post/have-your-say-on-the-future-of-cruise-tourism-at-dublin-port/) will have negative environmental impacts while not contributing materially to the locality (East Wall) or the city
* You're [sick of plastic](https://neasahourigan.com/post/sick-of-plastic-day-of-action-planned-for-cabra/)

## Disability rights

Vote No. 1 for me if...

* You want an [advocate for the disabled](https://neasahourigan.com/post/world-sight-day/) in the Dáil 
* You think we could do more to keep the footpaths clear for prams, people with disabilities and the elderly. [(1](https://neasahourigan.com/post/dublin-footpath-blockers/)) [(2](https://www.greenparty.ie/make-way-day-exposes-need-for-new-street-strategy/)) {{< youtube G7DvVclQkqA>}}

## 8th Amendment

Vote No. 1 for me if...

* You too wanted the 8th Amendment [repealed](https://neasahourigan.com/post/repealed/); if you're committee to exclusion zones around abortion services; and if you want to see all aspects of care fully legislated for.

## The Green Party Manifesto 2020

Vote No. 1 for me if...

* You broadly agree with the aims set out in the [Green Party Manifesto 2020](https://www.rte.ie/news/2020/0125/1110908-greens-manifesto/)
