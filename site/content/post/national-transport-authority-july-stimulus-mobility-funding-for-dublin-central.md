Projects include:

* road, cycleway footpath resurfacing
* modifying Pedestrian push buttons to contactless operation
* protective bollards/orcas for cycleways
* provision of segregated cycle tracks
* build outs at both busy bus stop and temporary footpaths
* pencil bollards specifically for delineating school approaches and no parking areas
* Bike Bunkers
* Provision of 80 secure and sheltered city centre cycle spaces within existing car park with security and CCTV provided.

The funding was allocated under the July Jobs Stimulus Plan announced by the Government last month and is among measures designed to stimulate a jobs-led recovery and build economic confidence in response to the Covid-19 crisis.

The funding will support local authorities’ response to Covid-19 challenges and assist with their work to equip local communities and businesses with improved walking and cycling infrastructure.

The funding will also allow for changes to traffic management arrangements to facilitate the reallocation of overall road space to improve facilities and safety for pedestrians and cyclists. 

Funding allocations have been made solely for design and works which can be completed by the end of November 2020.
