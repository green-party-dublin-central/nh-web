description: A property developer has started the first stage of Strategic
  Housing Development planning application process with An Bord Pleanála for the
  development of 112 apartments at the Balnagowan House site (also know as
  Wendon House or Bealnagown House).  This step is in advance of any formal
  application to An Bord Pleanála at which point members of the public would be
  in a position to make any observations.

[The application](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/case/310668) is at the Pre-Application Consultation stage. During this stage the applicant consults with Dublin City Council and An Bord Pleanála who will form opinion as to whether documents submitted constitute a reasonable basis for an application. That decision is due by 30 August 2021. If it is a reasonable basis for an application a formal planning application will be made.

It should be noted that Balnagowan House is on the [Dublin City Record of Protected Structures](https://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/2020-08/dublin-city-development-plan-2016-2022-volume-4.pdf) (Ref 8699) which affords it some protection.
