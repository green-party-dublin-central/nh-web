[Update 7-Jan-2022 - a full Strategic Housing Development application has been made and can be found [here](/post/balnagowan-shd)]

[The application](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/case/310668) is at the Pre-Application Consultation stage. During this stage the applicant consults with Dublin City Council and An Bord Pleanála who will form opinion as to whether documents submitted constitute a reasonable basis for an application.

On 5th October An Bord Pleanála made a recommendation on the Balnagowan House Strategic Housing Development consultation. The boards view was that the application "Requires further consideration/amendment".

In An Bord Pleanála's [opinion document](/docs/Balnagowan-Pre-Application-Consultation-Opinion.pdf) it says any formal application would need:

* Further consideration of the relationship between the proposed development and the adjoining protected structure, Balnagowan House.  Speific mention was made of the height of any new development and how that interacts with the protected structure. 
* Further consideration of design proposals w.r.t. any future development of the Bons Secours lands 
* A statement describing how the proposed construction and excavation works will not negatively impact on adjoining lands
* Further details of the proposed materials and finishes to the scheme. 
* A report that addresses residential amenity, specifically how the development will limit potential impacts on adjoining properties in terms of overlooking and overbearing.
* A comprehensive daylight and sunlight assessment examining the proposed dwelling units and amenity / open spaces, as well as potential impacts on daylight and sunlight to adjoining properties.
* predevelopment strategic archaeological testing in order to assess the nature of possible archaeological deposits.
* Quality audit in accordance with Annex 4 of the Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets
* To address the issues raised in the report of the Dublin City Council Engineering Department – Drainage Division and in the report of the Transportation Planning Division
* Further consideration and / or elaboration of the documents as they relate to the proposed cycle route to access basement parking

Note that this does not prevent the applicant making a formal planning ​application under the SHD process. Normally when the applicant makes a formal application they will include a document that specifically addresses the points made by the board.

It should be noted that Balnagowan House is on the [Dublin City Record of Protected Structures](https://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/2020-08/dublin-city-development-plan-2016-2022-volume-4.pdf) (Ref 8699) which affords it some protection.\
