date: 2021-08-03T11:23:48.304Z
description: A property developer has started the first stage of Strategic
  Housing Development planning application process with An Bord Pleanála for the
  development of 112 apartments at the Balnagowan House site (also know as

[The application](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/case/310668) is at the Pre-Application Consultation stage. During this stage the applicant consults with Dublin City Council and An Bord Pleanála who will form opinion as to whether documents submitted constitute a reasonable basis for an application. That decision is due by 30th August 2021. If it is a reasonable basis for an application a formal planning application will be made.

It should be noted that Balnagowan House is on the [Dublin City Record of Protected Structures](https://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/2020-08/dublin-city-development-plan-2016-2022-volume-4.pdf) (Ref 8699) which affords it some protection.\
