Hines plans to submit a planning application within the next month and, assuming planning is granted, to start building in 2022. Hines expects a 4 year build.

7.74 hectare Hines development
5.12 hectare GAA land planed for pitches (not part of this development)

Hines provided the following details:

* 23% site coverage i.e. remainder is open
* 1,641 units (80% build to rent, 10% social, 10% affordable)

* The two largest buildings will be 13 and 18 storeys

Focus on:

* keeping existing landmarks and trees on site
* keeping the lands open for public access
* reusing existing historic buildings (as residences and community amenity buildings)
* sustainability - looking at 3 sustainable certifications

Access:

* Clonliffe Road (main access)
* Drumcondra Road (left in, left out)
* Holy Cross Avenue (pedestrian/cycle only)
* Hope to have future access to Richmond Rd - walking and cycling only
* Internal barrier control to prevent rat running
* 500 car spaces

Social Housing in two separate buildings:

* 10% for Dublin City Council, 160 units, matching unit mix across the scheme
* 10% affordable (not yet clear how that will be managed)
