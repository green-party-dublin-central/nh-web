  Want to see your next Green Party TD in action behind the decks? Look no
  further.


  The Dublin Central Greens are spinning records in The Big Romance on October
  29th to raise the money we need to get Neasa Hourighan elected to Dáil Éireann
  in the upcoming election. Come down to join us for some chats, some fun - and
  to help us raise the money we need to hit the ground running in the next
  election.

We can promise:

* Great music (Neasa will be spending some time on the decks!)
* Nice pints/cocktails
* A raffle with some whopper prizes
* The chance to pick up some Green merch
* Caint agus craic with the members of the Green Party Dublin Central Branch

Tickets are a €10 donation, and you can get them here: <http://tickets.neasahourigan.com/>. **Even if you can’t come, please buy a supporter ticket to do your bit to get more Green voices into Dáil Éireann.** Anybody who buys a ticket (attendee or supporter) will be entered into a separate ticket holders raffle.

Why do we need to fundraise? Unfortunately running a General Election campaign does have some costs associated with it (e.g.postering, social media advertising, etc.). The party does not accept donations from big corporations or lobby groups so fundraising events like this are important to us.

We’re thankful to people/companies that have so far donated items for the raffle: 

* [Honest2goodness](https://www.honest2goodness.ie/?utm_source=neasa-hourigan&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=fundraiser) market - a fabulous market packed with sustainable food and produce every Saturday morning in Glasnevin. Evening market on Thursdays.
* [HelpStay](https://helpstay.com/?utm_source=neasa-hourigan&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=fundraiser) -  a skills-based volunteering platform that connects travellers with Hosts of great projects around the world.
