## What is a Large-scale Residential Development (LRD)

Large-scale Residential Development is the process that replaces the Strategic Housing Development (SHD) process. It is similar to the SHD process in that it deals with applications for 100 or more houses or 200 or more student accommodation bed spaces.

A key difference however is that Large-scale Residential Development applications are made directly to the local authority (Dublin City Council in this case). Strategic Housing Development applications were made to An Bord Pleanála.

## Unix Mix

The residential units will be split across 9 blocks:  A, B, C, D-E, F, G, H, J, and L. Block K is the location of the community facilities.

The units are split as follows

* 494 standard design apartments 
* 317 Build to Rent apartments

Note that this refers to the building standards. The Build to Rent apartments *must* be rented for a minimum of 15 years. The standard design apartments *may* be  rented or sold.

The 811 units in the development are split as follows:

* 18 studios
* 387 one bed apartments
* 349 two bed apartments
* 57 three bed apartments
  	

## Height

The blocks are laid out as follows

* Block A: 2 to 7 storeys
* Block B: 8 storeys
* Block C: 6 to 7 storeys
* Block D-E: 5 to 13 storeys
* Block F: 4 to 9 storeys
* Block G: 4 to 9 storeys
* Block H: 5 storeys
* Block J: 4 storey (extension to St. Vincent’s Hospital building)
* Block K: refurbished St. Vincent’s Hospital building
* Block L: 4 to 6 storeys
