  As spring turned into summer the campaign to repeal the 8th was a whirlwind
  and we still can't believe the result.

The legislation is all important though so all of us organisers with Dublin Central Together4yes will be keeping our eyes peeled and our ears open.

It was a rainy cold February when we started but we didn't let that slow us down. Something important happened with Repeal. Representatives across the political divide put everything aside to deliver this important ref. We will (of course ) disagree in the future but it was an honour working with everyone this year.

We did it! Repealed!!!
