## Summary

* Works undertaken to convert premises from a café to a funeral home (Chapel of Rest)
* Dublin City Planning Enforcement Officer Issued warning letters to the property owner (File Reference E0456/24).
* The Planning Enforcement Officer contacted the owner and was informed that a retention planning application will be lodged.
* Retention Planning Application made on 26 Jun 2024, reference 3907/24

## Retention planning application

A retention planning application is viewed the same way as a normal planning application with the exception that the fees are about three times more expensive than a regular planning application.  Such fees are generally not material in a project where construction work takes place i.e. fees go from €3.60 per sqm to €10.80 per sqm.

The fact the planning application is a retention planning  application is not in itself a grounds for refusal. Any retention planning application is assessed against the same criteria as a regular application.

The primary incentive for not going the retention route is that there is a risk that the retention will not be granted or part granted. This would then require the applicant to undo some of the work done.

## Making an observation

When the retention planning application is made anyone may make an observation based on planning grounds. Some detail on this can be found at <https://neasahourigan.com/observation>

Sample grounds might include: traffic and transport impacts; adherence to zoning guidelines; impact of the amenity of the area.

It is unlikely that the following would be grounds for refusal: previous planning history of the individual; the fact that the application is a retention application.

## Zoning

1A Carlingford Road would be in zone Z2. Zone Z2 does list funeral homes as under “Open for Consideration Uses”. Development Plan zoning pages are included as an attachment.
