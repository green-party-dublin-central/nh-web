She said, "As we move out of the Covid crisis we are left with the stark aftermath of a very difficult time for children. Not only are some trying to cope with the direct impacts of the pandemic in the form of familial illness but many children did not have access to the kinds of services and community supports that would normally be available to them.

"I welcome the suggestion in the INTOâ€™s pre budget submission that mental health in school settings be a core funding commitment in Budget 2023. For so many children their school is the first point of contact with available services. However it has become increasingly clear that a robust and comprehensive approach to mental health services for minors will require a joint approach between stakeholders in the field. I am urging the Department of Education and the Department of Health to work in collaboration in funding meaningful mental health services that can be accessed through school settings.

"This would be a novel approach for both Departments but if we are to have an early Budget that deals addresses the cost of living it should not be at the expense of more progressive solutions to new challenges. Children in Ireland need, now more than ever, to feel that the state provide for their well being in conjunction to their basic needs. A collaborative approach between Departments would facilitate this."
