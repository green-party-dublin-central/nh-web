title: Daneswell/Smurfit Site Large-scale Residential Development planning application
date: 2022-08-16T13:14:52.073Z
description: >
  At the start of August a Large-scale Residential Development application was
  made to Dublin City Council for the development of 168 apartment units, a
  creche, and café at Daneswell Place, Former Printworks/Smurfit Site, Botanic
  Road, Glasnevin, Dublin 9. The application was declared invalid on the 9th of
  August as Dublin City Council felt the description contained in the
  application was insufficiently detailed for the public. It is presumed that
  this issue will be corrected by the applicant and a new application will be
  made.  A summary of the application as was made can be found below.

## What is a Large-scale Residential Development (LRD)

Large-scale Residential Development is the process that replaces the Strategic Housing Development (SHD) process. It is similar to the SHD process in that it deals with applications for 100 or more houses or 200 or more student accommodation bed spaces.

A key difference however is that Large-scale Residential Development applications are made directly to the local authority (Dublin City Council in this case). Strategic Housing Development applications were made to An Bord Pleanála.

## Unix Mix

* 168 apartment units 

  * 12 x studios
  * 72 x one bed units
  * 68 x two bed units
  * 16 x three bed units
* A crèche (expected 34 places, 43 during ECCE hours)
* Residents’ amenity space (gym, amenity rooms, etc.)
