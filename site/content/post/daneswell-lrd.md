## \[Update 13-Oct-2022]

On the 9th November 2022 [an appeal](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/case/315062) of Dublin City Council's decision to grant permission was lodged with An Bord Pleanála

## \[Update 13-Oct-2022]

Dublin City Council [granted permission for the development](https://planning.agileapplications.ie/dublincity/application-details/151700). 

A number of conditions have been attached to this grant including:

* The 10% of the site area required to be provided as public open space shall be achieved by omitting Block E in its entirety. The space released shall be incorporated into the public open space provision of the scheme. Block E was a 3 storey duplex block and provided 8 units. 
* A minimum of 20 percent of all car parking spaces shall be fitted with functioning electric vehicle stations or points and all remaining car parking spaces shall be ducted to facilitate future installation of EV charging points or stations. 
* Railings to remain in current position with space set aside should they need to be moved as a result of BusConnects.
* Communal resident facilities shall not be commercial facilities
* A public artwork shall be commissioned and installed in the public open space.
* A development contribution of €1.1 million shall be paid to Dublin City Council as a contribution towards expenditure in respect of public infrastructure benefiting development.

## Differences between the 9th Aug. application and 22nd Aug. application

Dublin City Council declared the 9th Aug. application invalid because it was "insufficient for the information of the public".  In particular the application did not contain sufficient information on what permission has already been granted on the site. 

The new application contains the details of the permitted scheme.

In addition the following files were updated:

## What is a Large-scale Residential Development (LRD)

Large-scale Residential Development is the process that replaces the Strategic Housing Development (SHD) process. It is similar to the SHD process in that it deals with applications for 100 or more houses or 200 or more student accommodation bed spaces.

A key difference however is that Large-scale Residential Development applications are made directly to the local authority (Dublin City Council in this case). Strategic Housing Development applications were made to An Bord Pleanála.

## Unix Mix

* 168 apartment units 

  * 12 x studios
  * 72 x one bed units
  * 68 x two bed units
  * 16 x three bed units
* A crèche (expected 34 places, 43 during ECCE hours)
* Residents’ amenity space (gym, amenity rooms, etc.)
