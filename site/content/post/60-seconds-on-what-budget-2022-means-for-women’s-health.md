**Transcipt**: Hi! This is Neasa Hourigan TD and I wanted to give you a quick run-down of what Budget 2022 will mean for women’s health.

Myself and other Green Party colleagues have worked incredibly hard over the last while to ensure that women’s health is given a priority in this Budget. It is much needed and deserved. What we are looking at today is a package of €31million, which is not inconsiderable.

We will see funding for free contraception for women between 17 and 25. I consider this the first step towards rolling out free contraception for all women, but particularly that group sometimes struggle to access reproductive and health services that are affordable. I think it is really important.

We are going to see funding for the Maternity Strategy.

We are also going to see increased funding for something that is dear to my own heart, because it affects my family, that is perinatal genetics.

And in another section of the Budget we are going to see supports for perinatal mental health which is incredibly important and that sits in the mental health budget and *Sharing the Vision* which is €24million.

So all in all a good day for women’s health and a very progressive measure within Budget 2022.
