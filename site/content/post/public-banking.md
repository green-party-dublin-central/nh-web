The [position paper](https://neasahourigan.com/docs/Green-Party-Position-Paper-on-Public-Banking.pdf) calls on the Minister for Finance to: 

* Set aside the 2019 Indecon Report on Public Banking
* Begin a review of Credit Union and Post Office services
* Undertake an urgent review of: 
  * regional access and access of underserved communities to banking services 
  * with a view to establishing a material public banking system in Ireland 
  * and how that public banking system might be partially or fully supported by existing infrastructure (especially Credit Unions and An Post) 

The full position paper "Public Banking –A New Context" can be found [here](https://neasahourigan.com/docs/Green-Party-Position-Paper-on-Public-Banking.pdf).

Neasa spoke in the Dáil on 3rd March 2021 during Statements and Questions and Answers by the Minister for Finance on the Banking Sector. Many of the speakers on the night from across parties and groupings spoke to support some form of community or public bank model. Many also looked to utilize the Credit Unions and An Post.
