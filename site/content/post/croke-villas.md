The plans remain largely the same as have been approved in 2017 and 2020 respectively:

* Two storey houses to the north of Sackville Avenue
* A 4 and a 5 storey block on the old Croke Villas site

Remaining demolition is scheduled for Q3/Q4 of this year with construction expected to start in Q4 2025.

Properties, including this project, across a number of local authorities are being bundled together and put out for a single tender for construction of the housing.
