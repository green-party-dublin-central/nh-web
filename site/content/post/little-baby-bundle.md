  Bundle will be filled with a range of key items, including play items to
  encourage early communication and bonding, household items for help with safe

Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Roderic O’Gorman, T.D. has today announced details of the plan to pilot the ‘Little Baby Bundle’ with 500 expectant parents and newborns later this year. The pilot will be undertaken in collaboration with the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin and University Hospital, Waterford.

The Little Baby Bundle - an initiative under First 5, A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families 2019-2028 - is a welcome gift from the State for a new arrival to a family - acknowledging this very significant and special moment for parents.

Designed to promote the health and well-being of newborns and help parents in the first days and weeks of a baby’s life, the Little Baby Bundle is inspired by similar successful initiatives in Scotland and Finland.

Commenting on the plans, Minister O’Gorman said:

> “We’ve seen the success of similar initiatives in Scotland and Finland and so I’m delighted to announce these plans to pilot the Little Baby Bundle in collaboration with our partners – the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin and University Hospital, Waterford.
> The Little Baby Bundle is about giving each of Ireland’s newest little arrivals a welcome gift, while also providing parents with practical supports as they navigate those special first few weeks and months in their child’s life”.
