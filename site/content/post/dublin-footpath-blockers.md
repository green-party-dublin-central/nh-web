  So I started a little campaign in the last few months. As you may know my 6
  year old is a white cane user. As we try and encourage her to use it on the
  street it has become very apparent that our public streets and civic
  environment isnâ€™t actually very friendly to people with disabilities.

Cars parked up everywhere, overgrown hedges, broken pavements, dog dirt, the list is endless. (On some level I knew this of course but it becomes very immediate and undeniable when you have to explain it to a small child.)

So I have created Dublin Blockers. We're on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. You should contact you're local Garda station or DSPS to report dangerous or inconsiderate parking but also take a snap and send it to one of our accounts. It can be useful to chart this kind of thing in an easily accessible place. (And also if I reported every example of this I would be on the phone 5-8 times everyday!)
