The detail of An Bord Plean치la's decision can be found [here](https://neasahourigan.com/docs/Daneswell-Decision.pdf). That decision reflects concerns raised by many of you and included in [our submission](https://neasahourigan.com/docs/Observations-on-Botanic-SHD-Final.pdf) made to An Bord Plean치la.\
\
As per our submission, the city continues to need more quality accommodation and it is our desire to see the site developed in a manner appropriate to the location.  There is extant planning permission for 119 units (76 apartments and 43 houses) on this site which is an option for the developer.
