## Transcript

Hi everyone.  So it looks like the Green Party has passed the Programme for Government negotiated with Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael

The Green Party had a really open and in-depth policy debate around the proposal that we were given I have enormous respect for our membership and their huge commitment to grassroots democracy even when things get difficult and things get tough

I've also heard in the last few weeks from my constituents on either side of the debate. I really appreciate people taking the time to get in contact and to make their views known. I think that's really important.

So, what do we do from here?

It's been a bruising few months if I'm honest.

I think the best way forward is firstly to continue to advocate for people in our community who are marginalised, for people who are driven into poverty, people struggling to pay their rent, those who need affordable housing, children,  people with disabilities, carers.

And secondly, I think we should work together to hold all of the coalition partners to the commitments they made in the Programme for Government and to ensure that both the hard and soft commitments are delivered to the best of our ability

So that's what I intend to do. That's what I see as the best course of action

I hope I can do that effectively and I hope I can live up to the trust that the voters in Dublin Central put in me.  Bye!
