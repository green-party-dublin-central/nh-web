description: >-
  Neasa speaks for 60 seconds on well-being indicators. This method of
  decision-making would compel Government to consider broader metrics than just
  the nation's GDP (or GNI*). It would consider - are we happy? Are we being
  fair to everyone? Are we planning for the future welfare of others?


  WelI-being budgets, coming soon...
