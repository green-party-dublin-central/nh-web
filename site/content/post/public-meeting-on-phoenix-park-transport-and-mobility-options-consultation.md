Speaking today Neasa Hourigan, TD for Dublin Central said:

> “There are many positives in this report in terms of both the core principles and key recommendations. That said I’ll be pushing for improvements including a firmer commitment than just ‘seeking’ to reduce commuter traffic and an explicit commitment to ensure access for all including the elderly, disabled, etc.”

The report can be found [here](https://assets.gov.ie/118538/2d426964-2654-4d66-9c93-7c2177dd150b.pdf). It is a detailed report but the Executive Summary gives a clear overview of the "Preferred Strategy"

At first glance there are two areas that need to be strengthened:

* A stronger commitment on the reduction of commuter traffic through the park. The current Preferred Strategy does very little to reduce through traffic on Chesterfield Avenue. This does not fully reflect the serious concerns of local residents and users of the park and does not address the urgent need to protect the park as a green lung for the city as we experience unprecedented levels of air pollution.
* Based on much feedback from Dublin Central constituents, an explicit commitment is needed to ensure that the included “universal access for all” addressed the unique needs of the elderly, disabled, etc.

The public consultation phase will commence on the 29th January for six weeks. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, this will take place online only. It will include a virtual room where members of the public can view the report and associated maps and tables. It will also include a FAQ section. Interested members of the public will be asked to make an online submission. At the end of this consultation period, an analysis of the submissions received will take place with the aim of publishing a final report in April 2021.
