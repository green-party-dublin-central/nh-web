Speaking today 

The public consultation phase will commence on the 29th January for six weeks. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, this will take place online only. It will include a virtual room where members of the public can view the report and associated maps and tables. It will also include a FAQ section. Interested members of the public will be asked to make an online submission. At the end of this consultation period, an analysis of the submissions received will take place with the aim of publishing a final report in April 2021.

The Phoenix Park Transport and Mobility Options Report makes a number of key recommendations including the following:

* Prioritise pedestrian infrastructure including the upgrade of over 7km of footpaths along with strategic pedestrian crossing points on Chesterfield Avenue and other key locations throughout the Park, including the Gate entrances
* Expand and upgrade the cycle network within the Park and linkages to the external networks to facilitate all cycling users. This will involve the creation of 14km of new cycle lanes and the upgrade of over 17kms of existing cycle lanes within the Park and at Park entrances.
* Traffic will be reduced on the North Road and the Upper Glen Road so as to improve the amenities in these areas. In the medium to long term, vehicular restriction will be introduced at Cabra, Ashtown and Knockmaroon Gates. 
* In the short to medium term a bus service will be introduced for Dublin Zoo and the Phoenix Park Visitor Centre, serving all areas along this route and linking to Heuston Station and Broombridge Luas Station.
* The speed limit will be set at 30kph with a review of parking and byelaws being recommended.
* It is recommended that the traffic restrictions proposed for the upper Glen Road and the North Road be piloted along with traffic data collection in the short term.
