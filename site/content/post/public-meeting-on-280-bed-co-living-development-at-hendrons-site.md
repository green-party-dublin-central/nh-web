**Neasa's observation to An Bord Pleanála** 

Neasa submitted this [set of observations](https://neasahourigan.com/docs/Observations-on-Hendrons-SHD.pdf) to An Bord Pleanála.

**Mailing List**

Sign up here <https://m.neasahourigan.com/hendrons> to receive email updates in relation to the process.

**An Bord Pleanála application**

An application was made on 7th December 2020 and is going direct to An Bord Pleanála under the Strategic Housing Development legislation. Any observations need to be in to An Bord Pleanála by 19th January 2021.

We are in the process of evaluating the application in detail but in summary:

**Co-living** 

The design is a 280 bedroom co-living scheme. The Minister for Housing has effectively banned new co-living applications but applications in train will be allowed to proceed. 

**Social Housing**

Sadly there is no social housing element to this development. Co-living developments are exempt from Part V social housing obligations.  

**Protected Structure**

On 22nd January 2020 Dublin City Council resolved to add Hendrons, 37-40 Dominick Street Upper to the Record of Protected Structures.  Full details [here](https://councilmeetings.dublincity.ie/documents/s27161/38%20Addition%20to%20RPS%20of%20Hendrons%20PF%202020-01-20%20FINAL.pdf).
