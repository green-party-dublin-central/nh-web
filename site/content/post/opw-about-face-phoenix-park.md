Deputy Hourigan, TD for Dublin Central said:

Just a fortnight ago the OPW announced that it would maintain the closure of the peripheral gates to the Phoenix Park in order to facilitate the significant increase in use of the park by walkers and cyclists of all ages in recent months.
At the end of the working day yesterday it announced that it planned to reopen the perimeter gates. 

No rationale has been supplied for this complete about-face. The OPW needs to be transparent about how this decision was made, what representations were made by the Minister for State and/or other TDs.

A consultation process was mentioned but no dates for this process have been provided.

The OPW is supposed to be a steward of the Phoenix Park but unfortunately, not  for the first time, it has been found lacking.  Based on communications I have received from members of the public it can expect vigorous opposition to this backward step.
