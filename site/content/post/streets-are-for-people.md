  Streets Are For People is an event series organised by a number of advocacy
  groups to take back our streets.  The effort is supported by members of the
  Dublin Central Green Party branch (including Cllr. Neasa Hourigan and Cllr.
  Janet Horner). We all want our public spaces to be cleaner, healthier and more
  people-friendly and are willing to take action to make that happen.

## Why

Why are we taking these actions?

* A city with more pedestrianised and pedestrian friendly streets will be better for everybody - commuters, children, the elderly and vulnerable road users. The city should not be dominated by private car traffic. 
* Car traffic is literally killing us. Nitrogen dioxide levels in Dublin are too high: "a significant number of areas in Dublin city have levels of traffic related air pollution that exceed annual safe limits in the European Union." - [RTE](https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2019/0708/1060952-nitrogen-oxide/) 
* The city centre is already congested with private car traffic
* Ireland (and the world) needs to reduce its carbon footprint

## What's been done so far

20th Jul 2019 - most of South William Street was pedestrianised for the day

31st August 2019 - a section of Liffey Street was pedestrianised for the day

Here's a view of what Liffey Street would look like when pedestrianised

Thankfully, in its September meeting, the City Council voted to moved ahead with the pedestrianisation of a portion of Liffey Street.  Detailed plans can be seen [here](https://www.dublincity.ie/councilmeetings/documents/s22513/190204%20DLS%20Part%208%20Area%20Committee%20Notification%20Report.pdf) 

It remains to be seen if this plan will be challenged by local car park operators and shopping centres.

## What's next

It's safe to say there will be more actions to come. Stay tuned to the Streets are for People [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/streetsare4ppl/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/streetsare4ppl) to hear about future actions.
