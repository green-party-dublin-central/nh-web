title: Council vote on Filtered Permeability trial in Grangegorman
date: 2020-12-08T17:00:24.808Z
description: On the 12th January Dublin City Council's Central Area Committee
  will vote on making the Filtered Permeability trial in Grangegorman permanent.
  The measure uses bollards to prevent motorised through traffic in order to
  create safer space for local residents, local school children and for
  thousands of pedestrians and cyclists arriving at Technological University
  Dublin. If you support this measure being made permanent you need to let your
  local councillors know (contact details below).

Neasa and Cllr. Janet Horner were in the area recently to record their reasons for supporting for the proposal. The street remains open to cars, cyclists and pedestrians the only difference being that the street is no longer accessible as a rat run. That will make a massive difference to school children, university students and commuters who will use this street.
