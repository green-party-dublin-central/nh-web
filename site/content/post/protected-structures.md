A protected structure is a structure that is considered to be of special interest from an architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical point of view. Owners or occupiers of a protected structure are legally obliged to prevent it becoming endangered, whether through damage or neglect. Each Local Council is also obliged to keep a Record of Protected Structures (RPS).

### ***How does the procedure for adding a structure to the Record of Protected Structures work?***

The procedure for adding a structure to the Record of Protected Structures is [outlined on Dublin City Council's website](https://www.dublincity.ie/residential/planning/archaeology-conservation-heritage/record-protected-structures/adding-site-building-record-protected-structures) and is as follows:

* The site inspection is the first stage of this statutory process for the consideration of adding the structure to Dublin City Council’s Record of Protected Structures.
* Following the site inspection, a report is prepared by the Dublin City Council's Conservation Officer outlining their assessment of the architectural heritage and special interest of the structure. Where the special interest of the structure is proven, this report will provide a recommendation to the relevant Area Committee.
* Where the Area Committee approves the initiation, the statutory process for the proposed addition of the buildings to the RPS can be commenced in accordance with Section 55 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 (as amended). This process includes the display of the particulars of the proposed addition/deletion for a period of 6 weeks, notification of the owner and occupier, publishing a newspaper notice, including an invitation for all to make written submissions or observations on the proposed addition/deletion.
* Once the official notification is provided to the owner and in a newspaper notice, the building becomes a ‘proposed protected structure’. From that date, the carrying out of any works that would materially or significantly affect the architectural character of the proposed protected structure, including its interior and fixtures, requires planning permission.
* At the end of the public consultation process, a final report and recommendation is brought to Dublin City Council within 12 weeks, which includes a written consideration of all the submissions and observations received.
* The decision on whether or not to make an addition to the Record of Protected Structures is a decision of the Elected Representatives. Notice of the decision of Dublic City Council is then provided to all relevant parties.
