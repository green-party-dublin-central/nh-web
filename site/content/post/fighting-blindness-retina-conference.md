I talked to Woman's Way about what it's like to support a visually impaired child and to let people know about the section of the conference that allows the public to ask the experts questions. Now in its fifth year, the Public Engagement Day offers people a unique opportunity to engage with leading clinicians and researchers and provides a platform for Irish patients to learn about their condition and the research that is aiming to find therapies to treat it.
