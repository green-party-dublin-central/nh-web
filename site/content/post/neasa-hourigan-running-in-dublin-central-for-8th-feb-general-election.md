We can do better in Dublin

* every single person should have a home, a roof over their head
* every child should have the option of walking or cycling to school
* cleaner air
* we should protect our parks and plant more trees
* it's not too late to do something about the climate crisis

If any of that sounds good to you vote number one Neasa Hourigan
