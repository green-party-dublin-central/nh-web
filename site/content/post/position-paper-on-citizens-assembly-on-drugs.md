date: 2022-04-26T09:00:13.385Z
description: "Neasa Hourigan TD has today published the Citizens’ Assembly on
  Evidence Informed Drugs Policy from a Harm Reduction Perspective, which
  proposes a framework for how the upcoming assembly might approach its
  work.  The paper calls for people’s lived experience to be made central to the
  Citizens’ Assembly. Harm reduction and recovery strategies are most
  effectively developed in collaboration with those experiencing the impacts of
  drug use and misuse. By centring the voice of individuals, families and
  communities experiencing the impacts of drug use the Citizens’ Assembly can
  seek to tackle structural problems that increase risk of drug problems. "

Neasa Hourigan, Green Party Spokesperson for health and TD for Dublin Central said:

“*We need to do more for those impacted by drug use in this country. First and foremost, on those caught in addiction and their families, but also on many other facets of society including: homelessness, strain on our health and justice services, organised crime, and anti-social behaviour.*

*We need an evidence-based drug use policy that comes from a position of harm reduction.
“The Citizens’ Assembly is a useful vehicle for dealing with contentious issues. The Citizens’ Assembly on Drugs Use needs to be able to consider a broad range of responses to our country’s problem with drugs. It needs to be informed by people with a lived experience of drugs and international best practice*”
