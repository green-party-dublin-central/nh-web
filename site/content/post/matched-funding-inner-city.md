Deputy Hourigan, TD for Dublin Central said:

> ‘The report published today is disappointing and a hugely missed opportunity. It demonstrates a lack of ambition and scope for improving community life in the heart of Dublin city. While I welcome the recent allocation of 10 million euro in funding for An Garda Síochána it is now time to do the serious work of investing in neighbourhoods and young people’s future in the city. An Garda Síochána has already received this much needed funding boost which will greatly benefit community policing and diversion programmes, although it remains unclear whether it has the capacity to staff the overtime required.’

Cllr Janet Horner, councillor for Dublin North Inner City said: 

> ‘In the past weeks, we have seen huge money pledged to increase policing to address safety in the city but we need to see even greater investment and commitment to resolving the social, economic and health issues at the root of many of these problems. We need more of a focus on creating meaningful opportunities for young people, diverting people away from crime and antisocial behaviour. Addressing the sources of these issues before they manifest as criminality and antisocial behaviour is better for communities, better for the people involved and a more effective use of Garda resources’

In criticising the response of the Ministers and Community Safety Plan Deputy Hourigan set out a number of ways in which matched funding could be utilised to address current challenges in the city and move our vision for living in the centre of Dublin away from a purely policing model.

* Additional funding of €1.5 million to the Dublin North East Inner City Initiative to revitalise the programme with a focus on parental support, early learning, resources for those in emergency accommodation, funding for research into child friendly and feminist city management and increased investment in integration programmes.
* €6 million in funding Local Drug and Alcohol Task Forces across the city. All those suffering with addiction issues should be able to access treatment services in their local area. Funding LDATFs across the city would reduce pressure on services in the centre of Dublin*. A renewed focus on the provision of consumption centres or injection facilities would support this undertaking
* €2.5 million to local sporting, artistic and community services. The inner city has some of the best clubs and arts groups in the country including football clubs like East Wall Bessborough FC & Sheriff Youth Club, boxing clubs like Corinthians and many more. Community centres such as Sean O'Casey Community Centre and Ballybough Community Centre in some ways provide the most important supports in the area but need funding. Investment in this category would also make space for the life of the inner city to be championed- revitalisation of the Royal Canal with benches and gym equipment or using George’s Dock on an interim basis for arts and creative space, parkour and skateboarding facilities.

Deputy Hourigan, TD for Dublin Central said: 
> ‘I call on the Ministers to not only provide this matched funding but consider a more significant annual commitment to investing in non-policing led community initiatives for those living in the inner city than exists at present. It is a wonderful place to live but we can do better.’
