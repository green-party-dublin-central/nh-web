In particular, should NPHET [renew/maintain its call](https://assets.gov.ie/74472/703f767798cc4172a8b115df05ae5651.pdf) for mandatory quarantining and other travel related measures, Government should give significant weight to that recommendation.

In considering the introduction of any mandatory quarantining, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties have highlighted a number of measures and stringent safeguards that could be put in place to ensure the legitimacy of any system. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Ensuring any proposed legislation is subject to pre legislative scrutiny and given adequate time to be debated in the Oireachtas;
* Any new legislation must be clear and effectively communicated to the public;
* Quarantine should be for a medically determined period of time;
* Centres for quarantine must be staffed with fully trained individuals who understand their duty of care.

Neasa has asked Government that a mandatory quarantining system now be considered, while taking on board the views of the ICCL in the letter attached below.
