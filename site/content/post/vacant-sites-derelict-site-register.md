### ***What is a vacant site?***

Dublin City Council’s Active Land Management Unit established the Vacant Sites Register on 1st January 2017. An identified vacant site is one which Dublin City Council is of the opinion that it has an area in excess of 0.05 hectares, is zoned for either residential or regeneration purposes and has been vacant for a minimum of 12 months.

### ***How can I report a vacant site?***

To report a vacant site, you can contact Dublin City Council at [vacantsites@dublincity.ie](mailto:vacantsites@dublincity.ie) or 01 222 3838/6272.

### ***What is the procedure for entry on the register?***

* Before entering a vacant site on the register, Dublin City Council serves a notice of proposed entry to the Vacant Sites Register on the property owner
* The owner may make a submission within 28 days after the date of such notice outlining reasons why the site should not be considered vacant
* Dublin City Council will consider the points raised and if it is of the opinion that the site was vacant for the 12 months concerned and continues to be vacant it shall enter the site on the register
* Upon entry to the register Dublin City Council will serve a Notice of Entry on the owner
* The owner may appeal this entry to an Bord Pleanála within 28 days after the date of such notice
* The burden of showing that the site, or a majority of the site, was not vacant or idle for the duration of the 12 months concerned is on the owner of the site
* Where an Bord Pleanála determines that a site was not vacant or idle for the duration of the 12 months concerned or was no longer vacant on the date on which it entered the register, it shall give written notice to Dublin City Council to cancel the entry
* Where an Bord Pleanála determine an appeal unsuccessful the entry to the register shall be deemed to have effect from the date on which Dublin City Council entered it

### ***What is a derelict site?***

The Derelict Sites Act 1990 defines a derelict site as any land that *“detracts, or is likely to detract, to a material degree from the amenity, character or appearance of land in the neighbourhood of the land in question because of....."*

* Structures which are in a ruinous, derelict or dangerous condition, or
* The neglected, unsightly or objectionable condition of the land or of structures on it, or
* The presence, deposit or collection of litter, rubbish, debris or waste.

### ***How do I report a derelict site?***

To report a derelict site, you can contact Dublin City Council at [planning@dublincity.ie](mailto:planning@dublincity.ie) or 01 222 2222. They will then carry out an inspection of the site to determine if it is qualifies to be entered on the Derelict Sites Register.

### ***What happens if your site is added to the Derelict Sites Register?***

If a site that you own is added to the Derelict Sites Register, Dublin City Council has the authority to:

* demand that you restore your site to a non-derelict condition within a certain time period. You are normally given six weeks to complete such work. A financial penalty may be imposed if you fail to do so.
* apply a financial penalty on you. This could amount to 7% of market value of your derelict site for every year it remains on the Derelict Sites Register.
* purchase property by agreement or by compulsory purchase order.
