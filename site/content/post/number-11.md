description: "The route served by the No. 11 bus is changing, not going away.
  The new 19 bus will: continue to go along Home Farm Road and Drumcondra road;
  will be more frequent than the current 11; and will provide a service to
  Dublin Airport. The 19 route is in addition to the N2 route that has recently
  started operating along Griffith Avenue."

I have seen some incomplete information circulated recently regarding the number 11 bus route. Any politician who had engaged with any of the various consultations on BusConnects over the past few years would know that the route served by the 11 is largely being replaced by the new 19 service.

The No. 11 bus currently operates every 30 minutes throughout the day and every 15 minutes at peak times. It was announced in 2020 that this service was to be replaced by the new No. 19 route which was to operate once every hour. [Cllr. Feljin Jose](https://feljin.ie/) engaged with many residents ahead of the local elections who were concerned about this change. Following Feljinâ€™s discussions with service providers the new proposal is a significant step forward.

* The new 19 bus will now operate every **20 minutes** throughout the day and with additional buses during peak times as opposed to the initial proposal of every 60 minutes.
* The new 19 bus will also provide a direct service to Dublin Airport via Ballymun Road and will pass the Collinstown GAA pitches used by Na Fianna.
* The 19 will terminate in the city centre. This will require a change for passengers going south of the city.  The increased frequency of the 19 will mean however that wait times will be reduced.

These changes are separate from the newly launched N2 orbital bus along Griffith Avenue.
