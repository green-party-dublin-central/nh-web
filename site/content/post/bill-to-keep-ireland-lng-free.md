title: Bill to keep Ireland LNG Free
date: 2022-02-18T09:49:32.082Z
description: "Today I published a bill with Not Here, Not Anywhere, that would
  deny planning permission for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) infrastructure. The
  Climate Action Plan 2021 provides a detailed strategy to achieve a 51%
  reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Building large LNG
  infrastructure would lock us into a fossil fuel energy model for decades to
  come "

Ireland’s future lies in renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, that minimises environmental damage, creates Green jobs and provides us with secure and affordable energy. This bill, drafted with Not Here, Not Anywhere, prevents the construction of LNG Infrastructure in Ireland and builds on the Government’s work to ban fracking within the wider context of the phasing out of fossil fuel extraction. It is an important step to prevent Ireland being locked into fossil energy which would damage our ability to fulfil our climate action commitments and further expose us to increased energy insecurity and price rises.

Aideen O'Dochartaigh of [Not Here Not Anywhere](https://notherenotanywhere.com/) said:

"*This Bill is the climate action we need now. To keep 1.5C alive we urgently need to phase out fossil fuels and LNG is a particularly climate-wrecking fossil fuel. Renewable energy is the future and LNG, which has devastating impacts on communities throughout its supply chain, is not a safe or secure source of energy. For climate, communities and a safe future, it is crucial that we keep Ireland LNG Free."*

Not Here Not Anywhere is a nationwide, grassroots, non-partisan group campaigning to end fossil fuel exploration and the development of new fossil fuel infrastructure in Ireland.
