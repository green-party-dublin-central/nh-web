**Deputy Hourigan, TD for Dublin Central** said:

“I recognise that the maternity hospitals’ imposition of visitor restrictions is based on patient and staff safety and that many hospitals are working in old, cramped, overcrowded buildings that don’t facilitate adequate social distancing.

That said I’d strongly encourage the minister and the hospitals to urgently review the restrictions around partners accompanying pregnant people to all scans and during all stages of labour. My Colleague, Lord Mayor of Dublin Hazel Chu, has received hundreds of correspondence from those accessing maternal care who outline the very real impact the absence of a partner can have on your well being.

Pregnancy and labour can be a stressful time, more so if there are complications, and some maternal care requires extended stays in care settings. Having a partner present when in hospital goes a long way to easing that stress.

Lord Mayor Chu and myself have written to the Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly to share these stories and are keen to meet with the Minister to discuss the issue.” 

**Lord Mayor of Dublin Hazel Chu**, said:

I have received over 700 emails from women across and outside Dublin, some of them heartbreaking, that speak about the huge stress caused by the current restrictions. I’ve already been in touch with The Coombe, The Rotunda and Holles Street hospitals to urge management there to find a solution that works for hospital staff and patients alike.  I echo the call for a national focus on this issue.
