title: Statement on the new National Maternity Hospital
date: 2022-04-14T10:54:03.604Z
description: The ownership of the National Maternity Hospital must be secure and
  fully in state ownership. Those accessing healthcare in Ireland have the right
  to expect that the Irish state has fully committed to provide the oversight
  and governance of state funded healthcare. This will not be possible where
  some of that oversight and governance is undertaken by a private entity. The
  current maternity services require investment and improvement- the Holles
  Street site has not provided the best practice conditions for some time now.
  New capital investment in state facilities will deliver care to millions of
  women for the next hundred years or more and it is imperative that the state
  is the central decision maker on site and that the decision making can be
  tracked entirely through state, not private enterprise, channels. This
  principle is important and worth investment, including the consideration of a
  compulsory purchase of the National Maternity Hospital site.
