**Transcript:**

*Neasa Hourigan TD*: The company Indeed recently announced a cut to its global workforce that will see 200 of its Irish workers facing redundancy. Numerous constituents have been in touch with me about their treatment. They told me about individual consultations with senior leadership who had no answer to basic questions; that people were given one hour's notice to engage in those one-on-one consultations even if they were on leave; and that management was seen to be shutting down the statutory consultation process as quickly as possible, causing significant stress to affected staff. What will the Government do to improve the legal provisions surrounding redundancies to ensure people are not treated this way?

*Tánaiste, Micheál Martin:* Regarding Deputy Hourigan's case, today the Government approved a strengthening of the consultation process for redundancies to ensure companies fulfil their obligations under the legislation to engage in proper, detailed and timely consultation with workers who are going through the traumatic experience of losing their jobs, the announcement of redundancies and so forth. That is the way it should be. I take on board the points Deputy Hourigan made in her presentation.
