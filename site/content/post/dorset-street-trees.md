Unfortunately these trees have failed, due in part to their confined in situ planting bays and the harsh environmental conditions that these trees are constantly subjected to along this busy street. Dublin City Council want to replace them with trees that are more likely to thrive.

Dublin City Council have informed me that the first wave of changes on Dorset Street is due to commence on Saturday 1st October and will be ongoing for the following number of weekends, this will include the removal of all trees on the street as they have failed. Dublin City Council want to install replacement trees over the 1st weekend in November 2022.
