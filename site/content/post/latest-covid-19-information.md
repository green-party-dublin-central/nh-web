# Health

As of 18th March 2020 there are now 366 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ireland.

Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer in the Department of Health, said: 

> Again, today we are seeing another increase in case numbers. The importance of social distancing cannot be underestimated. Everyone must play their role. We need to continue maximising our efforts to interrupt new transmission chains and keep clusters under control. Reduce your social contacts to those in your closest family network. Practice social distancing. Stop shaking hands and hugging when you say hello.
