description: A quick update on the plans for a new family court on a long vacant
  site bounded by Church Street, Hammond Lane, Bow Street and the Luas
  tracks.  The site used to be a Maguire & Paterson match factory and was
  acquired was acquired by the State in the late 1990s.  I welcome the fact that
  plans for the new family court are being progressed.

In November the Office of Public Works applied for planning permission to build a 19 court room facility (including mediation/support facilities and staff offices) on the site. This would be purpose-built facility for family law proceedings replacing the often unsuitable facilities used today.

A six-storey central atrium will connect the blocks on the four sides each of which are stepped in height:

* Bow Street/ Smithfield - two to four storeys.
* Hammond Lane - four to six storeys. 
* Luas line - four to six storeys
* Church Street - two to four storeys.

Given the good public transport connections to the site there will be limited parking provided on site – 14 car spaces in the basement for court staff.

The facility will be delivered under a public-private partnership. When the planning process is completed there will be a tender process followed by a construction phase. It is expected that construction will be completed by 2028.


The standard condition applied to permissions for developments with significant construction noise is for building works to be carried out between 7.00am to 6.00pm Monday to Friday and between 8.00am to 2.00pm on Saturdays.
