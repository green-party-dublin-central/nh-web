**Transcript**:

*Neasa Horuigan TD*: As the Tánaiste may be aware, the support scheme for free Irish Sign Language, ISL, interpretation for events and services is provided for in the Irish Sign Language Act 2017, although many sections of the Act have yet to be implemented. Half of the public bodies included in a report this year were either not aware of the Act or their responsibilities under the Act. This support scheme combats extreme marginalisation facing the deaf community. It is vital that we allow the deaf community the same access. Could we get an update on the implementation of the various aspects of the Act?

*Tánaiste*: I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. If I am not mistaken, I think that was an initiative taken by Senator Mark Daly at the time. It very much came from both Houses. We need to examine the implementation and commencement of all sections of that Act. I will follow that up with the relevant Departments.
