  We tried to imagine Dublin in 15 years time. Would the housing crisis be a
  distant memory? Would rents require you to surrender your passport and sign
  over your first born to get a roof over your head? Will we have done away with
  private car ownership because driverless cars had made paying motor tax and
  insurance a pointless exercise? Will we be living in a leafier, quieter and
  safer city?
