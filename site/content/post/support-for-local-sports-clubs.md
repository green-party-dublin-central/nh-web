**Transcript**:

*Deputy Neasa Hourigan*: I will follow up on Deputy Boyd Barrett's contribution because that is pretty much exactly what I want to say.  Although we have Croke Park in my area, we do not actually have a great many GAA clubs.  That is why areas like Cabra, for example, have Naomh Fionnbarra, which is literally the centre of our community.  It runs festivals.  It is the place where the community gathers and it is so important to us.  It might be useful to speak to how impactful that is when making some of these decisions.  We also have a number of very important boxing clubs and football clubs, which have an outsized importance in our community.  I refer to the like of Bohemians, Sheriff Youth Club and Dingle United, which really struggle, do not necessarily have community-based supports and resources and really need the backup of the Department.

*Minister of State Thomas Byrne*: As regards Deputy O'Sullivan's point on the appeals, there is an appeals process for disappointed clubs.  Every valid application will get a grant.  There may be some which are marked invalid, and they will have the chance to appeal that.  That will be announced at the time we make the launch.

As regards Deputy Boyd Barrett's point, disadvantaged areas are prioritised in this programme.  We did reach out to the Football Association of Ireland and the Irish Athletic Boxing Association to encourage them to get their clubs to apply because it is possible for clubs to apply for equipment.  The local club to me, the East Meath Boxing Club, applied for a new ring and got 100% funding for it.  I therefore certainly encourage clubs to do that.  There are people within the associations who help clubs but also in the local sports partnerships.  We try to simplify the form as much as possible to make it possible for everybody to apply.

We are, in response to Deputy Hourigan, encouraging the local authorities to make a more proactive approach to providing sports facilities.  I did detect a difference in attitude in Dublin City Council in that regard.  I have had a couple of meetings now with the new city manager, and he is very proactive.
