  Dublin Bus has announced that it is selling off a number of its depot sites to
  consolidate them into one area while freeing up those sites for housing. While
  making land available for housing is a great idea, and much needed, I will be
  working to ensure that this is not yet another sell off of public assets to
  private developers to make huge profits while delivering a minimal amount of
  public housing.

'Dublin City Council is planning to sell off more than a dozen depots, including potentially lucrative housing sites on Collins Avenue in the north of the city and at Marrowbone Lane in the Liberties, to fund a new super depot in Ballymun close to the huge Ikea store.

The council is proceeding with a €25m plan to consolidate 19 depots on the city's northside onto a single location, freeing up potential development sites and property that will be sold to finance the project.' <https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/councils-depot-plan-to-free-up-housing-sites-36366155.html>
