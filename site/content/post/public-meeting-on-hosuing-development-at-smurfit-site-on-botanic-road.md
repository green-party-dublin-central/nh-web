  There is a new housing development planned for the old Smurfit site on Botanic
  Road. We are holding an online public meeting on 20th July at 7pm to walk
  though the proposal and to discuss any concerns people might have with a view
  to including those concerns on any submission we make to An Bord Pleanála.
  Details of the development and how to sign up for the online meeting below.

Planning applications for housing developments of more than 100 residential units can be  made directly to An Bord Pleanála (as opposed to via the normal planning application to Dublin City Council). There is a five week period during which observations can be made by members of the public on the plans.

Details on the development can be found here: <https://botanic-shd.com/>
