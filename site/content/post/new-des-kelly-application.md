**Previous application** 

Dublin City Council refused planning permission for the [previous application](/post/development-at-former-des-kelly-showrooms/) in January 2022. The grounds for refusal were:

* Overall scale will be visually intrusive and overbearing. The excessive height and architectural quality together with the materials/windows will likely impact adversely on the character of the surrounding Phibsborough Architectural Conservation Area.
* Daylight/sunlight on adjoining properties.
* The development proposes residential accommodation which is considered to be sub-standard.
