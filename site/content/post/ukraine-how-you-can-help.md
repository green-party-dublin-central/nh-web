## How can you help those in Ukraine

The warm generosity Irish people have shown already is remarkable. With transport systems under pressure however, sending physical goods could add stress to the situation on the ground. Anyone who would like to help are being encouraged to donate to established Irish and international humanitarian organisations, as donating cash, rather than physical items, allows organisations to source relief items locally, ensuring quality and quick delivery to those who need them. A comprehensive list of live appeals has been complied by Dóchas, the umbrella organisation for Irish NGOs.

These include the following:

###### Healthcare services for Ukrainian nationals in Ireland

A specific webpage ([](https://eur04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hse.ie%2FUkraine&data=04%7C01%7Cneasa.hourigan%40oireachtas.ie%7C42d83f9d1eae4e1d5ffe08da13ec6d18%7Cce71ecf00b9747b2966cb4ecc8db23f2%7C0%7C0%7C637844203410369726%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=xDPSs%2Fr7zQGaD9t5sgrlVleyoaEGGtyzROsgRuq6%2BD8%3D&reserved=0)[here](https://www2.hse.ie/services/healthcare-in-ireland/ukrainian-refugees.html)) has been set up which by the HSE (Health Service Executive), Ireland’s public healthcare service, which will be regularly updated with information in Ukranian, Russian and English on the healthcare services, including mental health services, available for Ukrainians arriving in Ireland.

###### Teacher-informed advice for Ukrainian families (Primary Education)

The INTO has published translated versions of their popular ‘Tips for Parents’ guide in both Ukrainian ([here](https://www.into.ie/app/uploads/2022/03/2022-Your-Child-in-the-Primary-School-Tips-for-Parents-Ukrainian-Language.pdf)) and Russian ([here](https://www.into.ie/app/uploads/2022/03/2022-Your-Child-in-the-Primary-School-Tips-for-Parents-Russian-Language.pdf)) to provide helpful information to Ukrainian families arriving in Ireland and seeking to access primary education.

###### Recognition of Progessional Qualifications

Where a person wishes to practice a regulated profession in Ireland, they must engage with the relevant Competent Authority with responsibility for that profession to seek the recognition of their qualifications. For example in the cases of architects, solicitors and medical professionals, this would be the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI), the Law Society and, subject to the medical profession in question, the Medical Council, CORU, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI), or the Department of Health to name a few. A list of all of the regulated professions in Ireland, their corresponding competent authority and the relevant contact information for each authority is available [here](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/123679/f3dc868b-f95a-42fe-87b3-531983e3bd1f.pdf#page=null).

In addition, [NARIC Ireland](https://qsearch.qqi.ie/WebPart/Search?searchtype=recognitions) provides advice on the academic recognition of a foreign qualification by comparing it to a major award type and level on the Irish National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). The QQI NARIC database currently lists 18 Ukrainian qualifications, comparable to levels 3-10 on the NFQ, including general professional and higher education. NARIC Ireland is working with the NARIC network across Europe to continue building the list of Ukrainian qualifications. The NARIC Guide has recently been translated into Ukrainian and the Guide is also available in Russian.

###### Driving Licences

Ukrainians will be able to exchange their Ukrainian driving licence for an Irish driving licence, making it easier to move around and access work, school or other vital public services. An application to exchange a licence can be made in any National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) centre. An appointment to attend an NDLS centre can be booked online [here](https://www.ndls.ie/booking-service.html) at  or by phone at 0818919090. The new licence will be valid for 12 months and will apply to cars only.

The Road Safety Authority provides information on driving in Ireland including a detailed FAQ for Ukrainian drivers. This is available [here](https://www.rsa.ie/services/alerts/advice-for-ukrainian-drivers).

###### Helpline

A helpline has been set up in an office at the Irish Refugee Council in Dublin to advise Ukrainian arriving in Ireland on immigration and accommodation matters. The helpline is 01 913 1528 and will be open Monday to Friday from 10am to 1pm, and will be operated by Ukrainians.
