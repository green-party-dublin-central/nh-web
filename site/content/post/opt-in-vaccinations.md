Long prior to COVID, Green Party [health policy](https://greenparty.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Green-Party-Health-Policy-Jan-2016.pdf) has been to highlight the role vaccinations play in public health through education & engagement. 

As a country we have achieved over 90% COVID vaccination rates using this approach.

As such it's difficult to see a scenario where national mandatory vaccination helps rather than hinders the vaccination drive. I look forward to seeing NPHET/Department of Health view on this but I remain strongly in favour of opt-in vaccination.
