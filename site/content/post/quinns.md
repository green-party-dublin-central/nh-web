**Update 12 April 2021**

Dublin City Council have [refused planning permission](https://webapps.dublincity.ie/swiftlg/apas/run/WPHAPPDETAIL.DisplayUrl?theApnID=2187/21&theTabNo=2) for the development at the Quinn's site on the following basis:

* would not provide appropriate residential amenity to future residents due to the lack of quality private open space accessible from living areas.
* undue and unacceptable impacts on the residential amenity of neighbouring properties due to the combined impacts of overshadowing & overlooking.
* incongruous in terms of its design by reason of excessive height, bulk and mass; demolition of retained shopfronts contrary to preservation of the built heritage.

We had raised a number of issues with this application in our observation so feel the council's decision is reasonable. That said, like most people, we'd prefer if the site was developed.

**Rental only**

50 build to rent residential units i.e. there will be no option to purchase.

**Height/Layout**

Five storeys facing onto Drumcondra Road Lower to a height of 17m. Tapering to two storeys toward rear of the site.

Three commercial units (bookmakers, café and a retail unit) at ground floor facing Drumcondra Road Lower.

**Unit types**

Current mix of the 50 units is:

* 11 studio units
* 33 one bedroom units
* 6 two bedroom units

**Social Housing**

Under Part V legislation Dublin City Council has expressed its intent to buy units in the development.

At this point no detail has been provided in the application as to how many units (typically 10% so that would be 5 units) or how much is being paid for the units.

**Existing building/façade**

The developer's view is that "Quinn's is not of special architectural heritage" and the plan is to demolish it all including the retained façades to the north of Quinns.

The new building front will look something like this

**Parking**

86 cycle parking spaces and no car parking spaces (given public transport options available)

**Full plans**

Full plans for the development can be found [here](https://webapps.dublincity.ie/swiftlg/apas/run/WPHAPPDETAIL.DisplayUrl?theApnID=2187/21)
