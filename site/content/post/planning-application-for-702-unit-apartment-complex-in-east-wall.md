title: Planning application for 702 unit apartment complex in East Wall
date: 2020-12-11T11:12:52.288Z
description: An application to An Bord Pleanála has been made for 702
  residential units on the Castleforbes Industrial Estate site.  This is
  currently a brownfield/commercial site close to the city centre.  I do have
  some concerns about, among other aspects, the mix (i.e. 72% of the units are
  one bed or studio apartments). Given the housing shortage the development of
  this plot could make a significant contribution to the rental stock in the
  city.  A summary of some of the details of the development are included below.

An application was made on 4th December 2020 and is going direct to An Bord Pleanála under the Strategic Housing Development legislation. Any observations need to be in to An Bord Pleanála by 19th January 2021.

**Rental only**

702 build to rent residential units i.e. there will be no option to purchase 

**Height**

Up to 18 storeys (60.7m) high. City Development Plan has 24m height limitations. Part of the application argues why the development should be allowed to contravene this limit.

**Unit types**

Current mix of the 702 units is: 

* Studios 101 (14%)
* 1 beds 407 (58%)
* 2 beds 179 (25%)
* 3 beds 15 (2%)

Dublin  City  Council  Development  Plan calls for:

* a maximum of 25-30% one-bedroom units. This plan has 72% one-bedroom units (14% studios and 58% one bed)
* a minimum of 15% three-or more bedroom units.  This plans has 2% 3-bedroom units

Again of the application argues why the development should be allowed to contravene this limits.

**Social Housing**

Under Part V legislation Dublin City Council will buy 71 units for social housing:

* 10 studio apartments at €297k each
* 41 one bed apartments at €408k each
* 14 two bed apartments at €642k each
* 6 three bed apartments at €792k each

All prices estimated at a total cost of over €33 million.

**Other planning on site**

Planning has already been separately granted for parts of that site:

* Western corner [for a hotel](<* https://webapps.dublincity.ie/swiftlg/apas/run/WPHAPPDETAIL.DisplayUrl?theApnID=2143/20>)
