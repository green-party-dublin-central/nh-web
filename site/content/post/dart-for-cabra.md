DART+ South West is an introduction of DART services along the line coming from Glasnevin, though Cabra, under the Phoenix Park and out by Heuston along the Cork mainline as far as Celbridge.

In the current emerging preferred route there is a stop in Glasnevin (at the Des Kelly/Brian Boru site) and a potential stop at Platform 10 in Hueston. That’s a stretch of roughly 4km, much of it though Cabra. But there’s currently no stop planned for Cabra.

Beside the Cabra Road rail bridge there is a plot adjacent to the Carnlough Road housing development that would be at the 2km point in that 4km stretch. Although this plot is being used for access to the housing development during construction it is not part of the housing development and is presumably an option for a future rail station.

Based on the 2016 census within 750m of this site there is a population of about 16 thousand people. Within 1km, a population of about 25 thousand people.

A station here would give these local residents connectivity to Heuston, Parkwest, Celbridge and in the other direction to the new Glasnevin station connecting with Metrolink north past as far as Swords and DART+ West running between Maynooth and Connolly/Spencer Dock.

If this station is not built as part of the current project works it is my fear that the station will not be built for a number of years.
