The rally highlighted the housing shortage and the amount of vacant buildings in the city.



A huge crowd came out and shut down the city for approximately 2 hours. The Garda support for the landlordâ€™s heavies and the manner in which the eviction was done is less than we can expect from our guards of the peace.
