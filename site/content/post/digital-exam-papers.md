The State Examinations Commission (SEC) has finally agreed to roll out a pilot project to allow visually-impaired students to access digital versions of their exam papers. Up until now, many students with visual impairment relied on digital material during the course of their schoolwork but then did not have access to the same when doing state exams. Under the new pilot scheme, students with a visual impairment will have access to read-only PDFs. The SEC will now contact students whose particular circumstances bring them within the scope of the pilot.

This is a progressive move and will create better access to our education system for our visually-impaired community. It had been an issue I raised recently with the Minister for Education at Committee ([here](https://neasahourigan.com/post/reasonable-accommodation-at-state-examinations/)), and while there is lots more to do – around the use of pictures in orals for visually impaired students, the entitlement to extra time, to scribes – overall this is a huge step in the right direction. I am and will remain committed to continue this work making our state exams more accessible for our children.
