Today (Monday, 17th October) the first lump sum payment - the Autumn double payment - will start being paid to our pensioners, carers, people with disabilities and families, benefitting 1.4 million people. 

I know many people are feeling under pressure at the moment. The cost of the weekly shop has gone up and utility bills are rising. So I have outlined the payment schedule below to give people certainty and some peace of mind so they know exactly when these additional payments will be made to them.
