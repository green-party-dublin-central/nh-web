Councillor Ciarán Cuffe, Chair of the Council's Transportation Committee said:

"This is good news for Dublin, and for the tens of thousands of DublinBike users who have been seeking more stations in the city. It means that hunderds of Dublin Institute of Technology students at Grangegorman will now have three Dublin Bike stations on their doorstep.

Neasa Hourigan, Green Party Dáil candidate in Dublin Central said:

"I am pleased with the news, but we now need to extend the scheme up through Stoneybatter and into Cabra. The DublinBikes scheme has been a wonderful amenity, but it has been held back by the drip feed of funding from the Minister for Transport Shane Ross TD and the National Transport Authority. Since DublinBikes were launched in 2009 they have been an extraordinary success, but the roll-out has been delayed due to lack of funding. We are only at phase two of a fourteen phase scheme that was due to be completed two years ago.

"Area like Cabra and Drumcondra should not be waiting years for a scheme that has proved its worth and costs a fraction of the money it takes to maintain our motorway network. I am calling on Minister Ross to release funding of €30 m per year so that all phases of the scheme can be rolled out over the next three years. This would be a tangible investment in sustainable transport that would benefit residents, and visitors to Dublin. "
