**Transcript**:

Hi this is your 60 seconds on what on earth is a Climate Action Plan and why are all these Greens so excited about it?

You might remember earlier in the year with the support of opposition we agreed in the Oireachtas national climate targets and what this is is breaking that target down in a meaningful way at every Department and sectoral level. So, from industry to agriculture to energy - what are you going to do, how will that sector make the change? And those targets will be binding.

After a decade of inaction and a lost decade for climate action it is incredible to see this finally happening. It is exactly what Ireland should be doing. And in fairness it is what every country should be doing, setting down in legislation the changes that need to be made.

What you are going to see today is sectoral ranges and that is because the Departmentsâ€™ will get their range, their targets, they will set out what they are proposing to do, that will then go to the Climate Committee for review and finally come to the Government again. It will be a negotiation; it will be a national conversation about how we are going to do this, but we are going to get there.
