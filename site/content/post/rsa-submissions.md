description: "Feljin Jose and I made a submission to the Department of Transport
  as part of it's review of the Road Safety Authority. The RSA has failed to
  take a leadership role on issues that would actually lead to safer roads. It
  would be advisable to disband the Authority and form a new organisation with
  more relevant and effective structures. "
