description: "Turnout in the 2020 General Election was 51.2% in Dublin Central
  (down from 52.4% in 2016). In effect, just half of the electorate in Dublin
  Central decide who represents Dublin Central in Dáil Éireann. If you are not
  registered, recently turned 18, or have recently changed address see below for
  details. Changes made in 2022 means it is now much easier to register to vote
  - all you need is your PPS number and Eircode. Obviously, if you want Green,
  we would encourage you to vote Green. How you vote however is up to you. "

## How do I vote?

Irish elections are based on proportional representation with a single transferable vote. In effect you rank the candidates in order of preference. If your candidate is eliminated or has a surplus of votes above the quota your vote will move to the next candidate on your list. As such it is wise to vote all the way down the ballot as explained in [more detail here.](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/why-it-pays-to-vote-all-the-way-down-the-ballot-paper-1.2548241)
