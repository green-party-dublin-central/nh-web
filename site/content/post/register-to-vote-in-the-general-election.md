## Who can vote in the General Election?

Irish and British citizens resident in Ireland can be added to the Register of Electors. Being on the register will allow you to vote in the General Election election.

## How do I get on the Register of Electors?

The register is compiled in November. After November you can apply to be added to the Supplement to the Register of Electors which will allow you to vote.

If you have a verified MyGovID account you can register or edit your details on [voter.ie](https://www.voter.ie/)

If you would prefer to register with paper forms you must complete an "[Application for inclusion in the Supplement to the Register of Electors](/docs/RFA2.pdf)". This form must be signed in the presence of a member of the Garda Síochána from the applicant's local Garda Station. The Garda may require photographic identification (e.g. passport, driving licence etc.).

## How do I vote?

Irish elections are based on proportional representation with a single transferable vote. In effect you rank the candidates in order of preference. If your candidate is eliminated or has a surplus of votes above the quota your vote will move to the next candidate on your list. As such it is wise to vote all the way down the ballot as explained in [more detail here.](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/why-it-pays-to-vote-all-the-way-down-the-ballot-paper-1.2548241)
