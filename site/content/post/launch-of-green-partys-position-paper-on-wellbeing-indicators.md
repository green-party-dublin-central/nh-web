GDP is not a way to measure the wellbeing and the quality of life of Irish Citizens. Having established a group to look at the potential for using Wellbeing Indicators to measure the welfare of the Irish nation, Deputies Neasa Hourigan and Marc Ó Cathasaigh today launched the Party's [position paper](/docs/Wellbeing-Indicators-position-paper-Nov-2020.pdf) on Wellbeing Indicators.

Speaking about the paper, Deputy Neasa Hourigan, Green Party Spokesperson for Finance, said: 

> "We need to run the country less like a business focused solely on the bottom line and more like a community focused on the welfare of all its members - wellbeing indicators will be a step toward that."
