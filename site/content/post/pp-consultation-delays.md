  Strategy

  On the 16th of July Minister Patrick O'Donovan, after his decision to re-open
  the Phoenix Park gates, told us a "consultation process on the Phoenix Park
  Traffic Management Strategy, involving all stakeholders" was expected to take
  place during August/September of this year. As of the 9th of September the
  Minister is now saying he cannot confirm exact dates for commencement and
  completion of such a process but that he wants to advance this process in
  "coming weeks and months." It is disappointing to see that the dates on this
  important piece of work are slipping already.

The decision making process around the Minister's reopening of the Phoenix park gates was opaque. As documented from numerous Freedom of Information requests (see [summary here](https://neasahourigan.com/post/were-the-phoenix-park-gates-reopened-based-on-just-6-emails/)), there was no data to support reopening the gates from An Garda Síochána, Dublin City Council or the OPW itself. The OPW's own records showed the public were overwhelmingly in favour of the closure of the gates.

The only positive from the whole affair was that the Minister commited to a prompt turnaround on the consultation process. It's dissapointing that this consultation process is now being pushed out to some undefined point in the future.
