title: Funding crisis at Dublin Zoo
date: 2020-11-18T11:19:49.090Z
description: At the start of October I made representations to Malcolm Noonan,
  Minister of State for Heritage on the funding crisis at Dublin Zoo. While some
  funding has been secured there remains a gap as a result of the COVID related
  drop in revenue experienced by the zoos. This is an issue Minister Noonan
  continues to work on with the Taoiseach.

Minister Noonan and I recognise the value that Dublin Zoo, Fota Wildlife Park and smaller zoos around the country provide in terms of species conservation, education, and as a recreational resource.

Prior to October Minister Noonan took the initiative of meeting with Dublin Zoo, Fota Wildlife Park, and the British and Irish Zoos Association (BIAZA) to assess the challenges within the sector.

We are both working to ensure to the future viability of both Dublin Zoo, Fota Wildlife Park and all of our zoos and aquariums.

I spoke with Claire Byrne on RTÃ‰ today at 11am on this issue.
