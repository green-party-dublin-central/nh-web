description: >-
  Universal Basic Income (UBI) operates as a standard payment to every
  individual that is resident in the state without reference to their means or
  their ability/availability for employment. It is non-means tested and does not
  increase or decrease as someoneâ€™s income changes. The Universal Basic Income
  would replace a number of social welfare payments and be a new way of
  providing a social safety net.
