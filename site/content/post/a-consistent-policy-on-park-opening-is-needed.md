  The Green Party wants to see a consistent policy on park opening regardless of
  the body that is managing that park. We currently have the situation where,
  for example, Dublin City Council parks are open but Botanic Gardens, St.
  Stephen’s Green and Iveagh gardens (under the control of the Office of Public
  Works) are closed.

If Dublin City Council, Waterways Ireland and other managers of green amenities can open parks and green spaces in a safe manner (safe for staff, car parks closed to discourage travel beyond 2km, socially distant etc.) we would hope that this approach would be applied consistently across the board.

Neasa Hourigan, TD for Dublin Central said:

“_We need to do as much as possible to make the 2km from home restriction as practical as possible for people. Access to a green space is important for people’s mental well being especially for people living in urban environments. I would encourage bodies managing green amenities to do as much as a practical to make our green spaces available to citizens at this time_”

[Claire Byrne, Councillor for Dublin South East Inner City](https://www.greenparty.ie/people/claire-byrne/) said:

“_While we have some great parks in the City, not all of them are open at the moment. Not having a consistent shared approach in terms of access to parks during this crisis puts added pressure on the Dublin City Council parks and indeed on their staff, which is really unfair. We need to ensure that as many residents as possible, particularly those in apartments & flats, have access to Green space while also allowing for adequate social distancing. Opening all the parks would facilitate that._”
