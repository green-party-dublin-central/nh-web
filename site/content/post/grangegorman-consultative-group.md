The [Grangegorman Development Agency Act 2005](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2005/act/21/section/22/enacted/en/html#sec22) requires the convening of a Consultative Group which draws members from a variety of groups (e.g. Dublin City Council, Residents representatives, public representatives, etc.). The Consultative Group is in place to maintain an adequate communications strategy concerning the development of the Grangegorman site.

Meetings usually take place quarterly and presentations and minutes (once agreed) are published on the GDA [website](https://ggda.ie/agency/consultative-group). Details about the group, its members, and meeting minutes can also be found on the [website](https://ggda.ie/agency/consultative-group).

If there is anything you would like me to raise as part of the Consultative Group please get in touch on [neasa.hourigan@oireachtas.ie](mailto:neasa.hourigan@oireachtas.ie?subject=Grangegorman%20Consultative%20Group%20-%20query&body=Dear%20Neasa%2C%0D%0A%0D%0A) or [01 618 3172](tel:+35316183172)
