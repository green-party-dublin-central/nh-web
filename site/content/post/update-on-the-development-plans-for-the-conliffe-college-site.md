  If you didn't get to make the briefing from Hines Ireland today on the
  developments planned for the Clonliffe College site please find a summary of
  the key points below. Please note that this is an early stage plan. Lots of
  positives in the plan but also elements that we feel could be better. The
  shortage of good quality housing in the city has not gone away so it is
  incumbent on us all to make sure the best possible use is made of the site.

If you have any thoughts on the below please don't hesitate to get in touch with [Neasa Hourigan TD](mailto:neasa.hourigan@oireachtas.ie?subject=Development%20plans%20for%20the%20Clonliffe%20College), [Cllr. Janet Horner](mailto:janet.horner@greenparty.ie?subject=Development%20plans%20for%20the%20Clonliffe%20College) or [Cllr. Darcy Lonergan](mailto:cllr.darcylonergan@gmail.com?subject=Development%20plans%20for%20the%20Clonliffe%20College)

Roughly half of the site is being developed by Hines for residential use (circa 7 hectares), half by the GAA (circa 5 hectares). In addition to the hotel the GAA plan to develop a sporting ground comprising a Clubhouse and two pitches.

A masterplan for the Clonliffe lands can be found [here](/docs/Clonliffe-Masterplan.pdf)

The latest plan contains 1,650 apartments broken down as follows:

* 30% studio
* 30% one bedroom apartments
* 35% two bedroom apartments
* 5% three bedroom apartments

There will be no co-living on the site i.e. all units will have own kitchen

No apartments will be sold by the developers:

* 80% will be private rental
* 10% will be affordable rental
* 10% will be acquired by the council under Part V for social housing

Height

* The buildings will be mainly 2 to 10 storeys
* Two of the buildings are planned to be 13-15 storeys.

There's a focus on keeping the existing trees and adding more trees

A dog park is planned

There will be a riverside walk which will be part of a route that surrounds development

Green public open spaces

Allotments are being considered

Pitches - will be open to schools

Will provide a large crèche (circa 5,000 sq ft)

There will be an option for a bridge over the Tolka near the Tolka park. Still a lot of detail to work out on that with Dublin City Council.

Lands are currently zoned:

* Z12 - zoned (residential with 20% public access)
* Z9 - zoned along the banks of Tolka

Timelines:

* Lodge planning as a Strategic Housing Development with An Bord Pleanála (APB) at the start of 2021. While Dublin City Council are involved in the ABP application the application will not go through the typical Dublin City Council planning process
* 2023 - first residents to planned to move in 
* All complete 2026
