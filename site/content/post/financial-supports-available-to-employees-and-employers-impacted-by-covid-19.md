## COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment 

This payment (6 week payment of €203 per week) is available to employees and self-employed people who are unemployed or who have their hours of work reduced during the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic. This includes people who have been put on part-time or casual work.

## Employer COVID-19 Refund Scheme 

There is a mechanism to get the equivalent of the COVID-19 Support Payment directly from your employer. Employers who have to temporarily lay-off staff and who are not in a position to make any wage payment to them, are asked to keep their employees on the payroll and pay them an amount of €203. When they submit payroll returns to Revenue via their payroll provider, Revenue will refund the employer the €203.
