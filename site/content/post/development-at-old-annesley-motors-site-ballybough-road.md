The site has a long history since the Annesley Motors closed both in terms owners and in terms of plans for the site. LIDL are the current owners and there is [current planning permission](https://webapps.dublincity.ie/swiftlg/apas/run/WPHAPPDETAIL.DisplayUrl?theApnID=3143/14) on the site for a retail outlet (expires 23-Aug-2023).

The site has been vacant for many years at this point so development of some kind is needed.
