title: Replacement of the Number 11 bus service

  I’ve been contacted by constituents about concerns they have in relation to
  the replacement of the number 11 bus service by a new number 19 service. I’ve
  written to the National Transport Authority to request extension of the new
  service past Parnell Square. I’ll provide an update when I hear back from the
  NTA.  More details on the changes can be found below.

  Cllr. Feljin Jose and I have been engaging with the NTA for the last 24 months to ensure that any changes to bus routes enhance the service and make public transport more efficient and accessible for the area. This includes successfully securing more frequency on any proposed new routes over and above the original proposal.

## What’s happening

The current number 11 bus service is being replaced by a new service, the number 19. The date for this change has not yet been finalised but it will be December at the earliest.  The NTA will distribute an information leaflet ahead of the introduction of the new service.

*Key changes*

* The 19 bus is planned to terminate in Parnell Square where the 11 goes to Sandyford
* The new 19 bus will provide a service to Dublin Airport via Ballymun Road and will pass the Na Fianna Collinstown pitches.
* The number 11 bus currently operates every 30 minutes throughout the day and every 15 minutes at peak times.
* The new 19 bus will now operate every 20 minutes throughout the day and every 10 minutes during peak times.
* The 19 services starts at 3am in the morning whereas the 11 currently starts at 6am

Key concerns that have been expressed to me are that:

* That the new route terminates in Parnell Square as opposed to closer to the city centre
* That the new route does not serve the southside
    
There has also been mention that the service starting at 3am is not welcome. As this bus serves the airport it does need to start that early to be useful to people travelling to the airport.

## Why is this happening?

This change is one of the changes being introduced under the BusConnects programme. BusConnects is a National Transport Authority's programme to greatly improve bus services. BusConnects is the first significant change to the bus network in Dublin since the Quality Bus Corridors in the late 90s.

Following three rounds of public consultation that began in 2017, the NTA finalised and published the new Dublin area bus network in September 2020. This was followed by planning applications for the 12 Core Bus Corridor Schemes where there were compulsory purchase orders for road widening or junction changes.
