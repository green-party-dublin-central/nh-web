When you correspond (email, Facebook message, twitter DM, telephone/video call, face to face conversation, etc.) with us on a matter we may record this correspondence for processing and follow up. The below outlines how we store and process that data (all pretty innocuous we feel!).  

<h3 class="f4 b lh-title mb2"> What we do with your correspondence</h3>
Neasa receives correspondence across a number of channels e.g. email (@oireachtas.ie, @greenparty.ie, etc.), Facebook, twitter, etc. In order to process this correspondence efficiently and ensure that (hopefully) nothing ever falls through the cracks we record the correspondence centrally in an issue tracking system.

Neasa's team use this tool to: a) respond to correspondence; b) track correspondence follow-ups and completion; c) check back with you on your satisfaction with any resolution.

<h3 class="f4 b lh-title mb2"> Who can access your correspondence</h3>
Neasa and her delegates are the only people with access to your data. If the correspondence is related to an issue with another state body limited details may be shared with that body.

<h3 class="f4 b lh-title mb2"> Am I being placed on a mailing list?</h3>
No. If you wish to join the mailing list you can do so <a href="https://neasahourigan.com/signup/">here</a>

<h3 class="f4 b lh-title mb2"> I want the data on my correspondence removed from your system.</h3>
Please send an email to team@neasahourigan.com requesting removal.

<h3 class="f4 b lh-title mb2"> What systems process your correspondence</h3>
Two systems: whatever system you sent us correspondence from  e.g. email (@oireachtas.ie, @greenparty.ie, etc.), Facebook, twitter, video conference, etc.; and Freshdesk
